## Brainstorming for Quarter 2 Project Proposal

**1) What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
[So far, the most interesting topic we have covered has been the PSPS shutoffs. It was interesting to hear about how SDG&E handles high wildfire risk events, espcially with the PSPS shutoffs that recently happened.]

**2) Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
[I would be interested in investigating how other spans and stations have to adjust when PSPS affects one span and find any trends.]

**3) What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
[I would add to our current approach of mapping all conductor spans to determine which stations would be shutoff by also including a feature to show which spans could potentially take on more electrical load due to a shutoff.]

**4) What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
[We have already used graph and visualization techniques, but I would also be interested in implementing a neural network with each weather station as a node and simulate a shutoff.]
